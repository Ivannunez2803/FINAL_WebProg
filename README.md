Hello! My name is Ivan Nunez, and I’m a Senior at New Paltz. My main hobbies are mostly playing guitar and listening to music. 

For computer experience, I’ve tried to be involved in learning file structures and various programs since I was a kid. Back in highschool, I was a part of the robotics team. I’ve played around with everything from modifying video games to digital audio workstations, and a personal hobby goal of mine is to make my own audio effects processor. I’ve taken Web Page Design, CS I - III, Assembly, Digital Logic, and Object Oriented Programming just to name a few programs. 

I’m very interested in how a server can be used by other users, and I hope this class goes in depth into the topic. I also very much hope to use this class to improve my HTML skills. Making a workout tracking website is also something I’m excited to do, considering my sister is training for a marathon, and I’d love to share that with her.
